# MC_535_Assignment1
Introduction
After the selection of gesture and last name from the first screen, we download the gesture as background task and store it in the local storage. This video is played using VideoView (play button onclick). The practice button opens up the camera and allows the user to capture a video. The captured video is stored in the local storage. This leads to the 3rd screen which allows the saved video to be uploaded to the server.

Requirements
The app requires storage permissions.
